You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative
integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes
contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the
number 0 itself.

**Example**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: (2 &#8594; 4 &#8594; 3) + (5 &#8594; 6 &#8594; 4)
<b>Output</b>: 7 &#8594; 0 &#8594; 8
<b>Explanation</b>: 342 + 465 = 807.
</code></pre>
