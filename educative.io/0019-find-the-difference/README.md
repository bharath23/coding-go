#### Find the Difference

Given two strings, `str1` and `str2`, find the index of the extra character
that is present in only one of the strings.

> Note: If multiple instances of the extra character exist, return the index of
> the first occurrence of the character in the longer string.

## **Constraints**:

- `0 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000`
- Either `str2.length = str1.length  + 1` or `str1.length = str2.length + 1`
- The strings consist of lowercase English letters.
