#### Merge K Sorted Lists

Given an array of `k` sorted linked lists, your task is to merge them into a
single sorted linked list and return the head of this linked list.

**Constraints**:

- `k = lists.length`
- <code>0 <= k <= 10<sup>3</sup></code>
- `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
- <code>-10<sup>3</sup> <= lists[i][j] <= 10<sup>3</sup></code>
- Each `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order
- The sum of all `lists[i].length` will not exceed <code>10<sup>3</sup></code>
