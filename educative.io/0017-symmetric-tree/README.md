#### Symmetric Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a symmetric tree. A
symmetric tree refers to a tree that is a mirror of itself, i.e., symmetric
around its root.

**Constraints**:

- The tree contains nodes in the range `[1, 500]`
- <pre><code> -10<sup>3</sup> <= Node.data <= 10<sup>3</sup></code></pre>
