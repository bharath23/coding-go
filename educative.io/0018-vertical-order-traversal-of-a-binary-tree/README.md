#### Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree

Find the vertical order traversal of a binary tree when the root of the binary
tree is given. In other words, return the values of the nodes from top to
bottom in each column, column by column from left to right. If there is more
than one node in the same column and row, return the values from left to right.

## **Constraints**:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 500]`
- `0 <= Node.data <= 1000`
