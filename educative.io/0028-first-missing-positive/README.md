#### First Missing Positive

Given an unsorted array, `nums`, return the smallest missing positive integer.
Create an alogrithm that runs with an `O(n)` time complexity and utilizes a
constant amount of space.

> Note: The smallest missing positive isn't the first positive number that's
> missing in the trange of elements in the input, but the first positive number
> that's missing if we start from 1.

** Constraints**:

- <code>1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- <code>-2<sup>31</sup> <= nums[i] <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>
