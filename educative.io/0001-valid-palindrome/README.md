#### Valid Palindrome

Write a function that takes a string, `s`, as an input and determines whether
or not it is a palindrome.

> Note: A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.

**Constraints**:
* <pre><code>1 ≤ s.length ≤ 2 × 10<sup>5</sup></code></pre>
* The string `s` will not contain any white space and will only consist of
  ASCII characters(digits and letters).
