#### Single Number II

Given a non-empty array `arr`, in which exactly two elements appear once, and
all the other elements appear twice, return the two elements that appeared
only once.

> Note: The result can be returned in any order. The solution should use only
> constant extra space.

**Constraints**:

- <code>2 <= arr.length <= 10<sup>3</sup></code>
- <pre><code>2<sup>31</sup> <= arr[i] <= 2<sup>31</sup></code></pre>
