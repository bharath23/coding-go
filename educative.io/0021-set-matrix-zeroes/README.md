#### Set Matrix Zeroes

Given a matrix, `mat`, if any element within the matrix is zero, set that row
and column to zero. The performed operations should be in place, i.e., the
given matrix is modified directly without allocating another matrix.

**Constraints**:

- `1 <= mat.row, mat.col <= 20`
- <pre><code>-2<sup>31</sup> <= mat[i][j] <= 2<sup>31</sup>-1</code></pre>
