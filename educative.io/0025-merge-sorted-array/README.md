#### Merge Sorted Array

Given two sorted integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, and the number of data
elements in each array, `m` and `n`, implement a function that merges the
second array into the first one. You have to modify `nums1` in place.

> Note: Assume that `nums1` has a size equal to `m + n`, meaning it has enough
> space to hold additional elements from `nums2`

**Constraints**:

- `nums1.length = m + n`
- `nums2.length = n`
- `0 <= m,n <= 200`
- `1 <= m + n <= 200`
- <pre><code>-10<sup>3</sup> <= nums[i], nums2[j] <= 10<sup>3</sup></code></pre>
